# QuizzWizz
A platform where teachers and students can engage in Quizzes. The teachers create quizzes and the students take them. The  teachers can show the the marks right on the platform or send an automated mail with the marks. This was for one of my course called CSE370 where I had to put together a fully functional webapp with a complex backend database.
